#+TITLE: skewer-lass-mode

Connects [[https://github.com/skeeto/skewer-mode][skewer-mode]] and Shinmera's
[[https://github.com/shinmera/lass][LASS]] (Lisp Augmented Style Sheets) for live CSS updates in the
browser, where the CSS is generated from LASS in a live website.

skewer-lass-mode is designed to work when your lass source is in its own file as well as when it is
interspersed with other Lisp code. In the former case, you will probably find
~skewer-lass-eval-defun~ and ~skewer-lass-eval-buffer~ to be useful. In the latter case, you will
mostly be using ~skewer-lass-eval-last-sexp~ and ~skewer-lass-eval-region~.

** Usage
   Call ~skewer-lass-eval-defun~, ~skewer-lass-eval-buffer~, ~skewer-lass-eval-last-sexp~, and
   ~skewer-lass-eval-region~ as necessary. You'll want startup Skewer and establish a SLIME session
   beforehand. If you enable the ~skewer-lass-mode~ minor mode, you get some default keybindings:

   - ~C-c C-M-x~: ~skewer-lass-eval-defun~
   - ~C-c C-e~: ~skewer-lass-eval-last-sexp~
   - ~C-c C-k~: ~skewer-lass-eval-buffer~
   - ~C-c C-c~: ~skewer-css-clear-all~

   (There's no default binding for ~skewer-lass-eval-region~).

   All these functions will try to load LASS via quicklisp if it is not present.

   If your LASS is interspersed with other Lisp code, it might be quoted. In a na√Øve implementation,
   ~skewer-lass-eval-last-sexp~ would pass the quoted sexp to the LASS compiler, which would cause
   an error. ~skewer-lass-mode~ will try to be a bit smarter, and will automatically evaluate quoted
   (or quasiquoted) expressions before passing them to LASS. If this is not desired, set the
   ~slime-lass-eval~ variable as per its documentation.
